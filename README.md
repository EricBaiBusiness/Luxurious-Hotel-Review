**By**: Sricharan Mahavadi, Chen He, Eric Bai, Min Xu, Olimpia Borgohain

### Project Motivation:
Hotels must exceed diverse guest expectations to thrive today. By unlocking insights from customer segments and hotel reviews at scale, hotels can understand what customers truly value, guiding improvements for more personalized, cozy stays.

### Problem Statement:
Can machine learning unlock insights from hotel reviews to help travelers find their perfect cozy stay in Europe and help hoteliers enhance guest service and their rating?
- **Recommendation system:** The results will display hotels recommended for families based on positive reviews of kids amenities.
- **Customer segmentation:** The results will cluster customers into groups like business travelers, couples, and families based on review preferences.
- **Sentiment analysis:** The results will identify top positively reviewed amenities and commonly criticized pain points.

### Dataset and Source:
- The dataset is from Kaggle, with the original data web scraped from Booking.com. It’s a comprehensive collection of ~515K records from 1450+ luxury hotels across Europe, featuring customer reviews, ratings, and geographical data. The source can be found [here](link_to_dataset).
- The dataset contains 17 features, including text-based customer reviews, numerical data such as average score, latitude, longitude, as well as categorical data such as hotel name, reviewer nationality, and review tags.

### Proposed Methodologies:
- **K-means clustering** to group customers based on review patterns.
- **Hierarchical clustering** to identify hotels with similar reviews.
- **Sentiment analysis** using NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization with NLTK to classify review sentiment and identify positive/negative hotel features.
